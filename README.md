I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies
I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL, I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com
/">GitHub Star </a> based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-
Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
